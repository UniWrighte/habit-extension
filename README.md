# habit-extension

Allows you to add URLs to a "grey" list.

The URLs on the list will create a dialogue every time you navigate to the grey listed site.

This note of "why" you went to the site is stored along with the date and time.

You can then download this log and review your cue -> habit -> reward cycle starting at the cue that causes you to visit the site.

Coming soon: a dashboard to review your habits from the extension
Coming soon: an optional feature to make a note when leaving the site (possible also after it's been inactive)
